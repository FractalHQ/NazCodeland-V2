-> convert svg components into svg files
-> give the palettes a title


- Perhaps colorSchemeAndThemePaletteStore can be broken up into two stores
since the logic of these two components is not intertwined anymore

- menuStore.ts and ThemePaletteStore.ts have 95% same functionality. Should
I turn it into one function if not possible, should I move them into one file?

--------------------------------------------------------------------
ColorSchemeStore has stores in two different locations. One is in the root of
lib and the other within the ColorScheme component folder.

the value of the store in the folder only impacts it's nested component. On
hover, the nested component shows up. What's tricky is that the lib/stores
store for ColorScheme has the same name as the folder store, but they don't 
clash because its in two different locations.

Question, since there is already a global colorScheme store should I also
move the folder store there?
