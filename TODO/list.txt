change the paletteTheme name in localstorage and elsewherre to something different
convert svg components into svg files
fix clashing css styles
give the palettes a title and make them keyboard accessible

remove all the .index files and import functions/files directly 

the site seems to load with no background color then background color kicks in, why is that.
This behavior is slightly different than expressjs version


- Perhaps colorSchemeAndThemePaletteStore can be broken up into two stores
since the logic of these two components is not intertwined anymore


- menuStore.ts and ThemePaletteStore.ts have 95% same functionality. Should
I turn it into one function if not possible, should I move them into one file?
